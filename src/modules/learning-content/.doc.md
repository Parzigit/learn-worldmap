# Learning Goals

Everything related to `LearningGoal` and `Exercise` kinda abstraction.

## Structure

### `data/`

Contains JSON files generated with python, once.

- `*.min.json` are minified JSONs with the full data, to be used
- `*.demo.json` is the same in pretty-printed and reduced to a few objects, so we can see the structure

### `dataTypes.ts`

A type file with interfaces that should match the generated JSON exactly.
The generated JSON should be dicts where the key is the name/id of the thing, and the value of each is a valid `MapExerciseData` or `MapLearningGoalData`
