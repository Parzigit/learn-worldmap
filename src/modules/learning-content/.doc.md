# Learning Goals

Everything related to `LearningGoal` and `Exercise` kinda abstraction.

## Structure

### `data/`

Contains JSON files generated with python, once.

- `*.min.json` are minified JSONs with the full data, to be used
- `*.demo.json` is the same in pretty-printed and reduced to a few objects, so we can see the structure

### `dataTypes.ts`

A type file with interfaces that should match the generated JSON exactly.
The generated JSON should be dicts where the key is the name/id of the thing, and the value of each is a valid `MapExerciseData` or `MapLearningGoalData`



## Files and Components

### Core Types and Interfaces

**`learning-goal/LearningGoalType.ts`**
- Defines the `LearningGoal` interface with all properties
- Contains arrays for parents, children, blockedBy relationships
- Includes inherent interest/difficulty scores and geopolitical data

**`exercise/ExerciseType.ts`**
- Defines the `ExerciseType` interface for map exercises
- Contains exercise ID, instruction text, and map data (zoom, country, panIndex)
- Includes parents array linking exercises to learning goals

**`dataTypes.ts`**
- `LearningGoalData`: Raw JSON structure for learning goals
- `MapLearningGoalData`: Extended with geopolitical unit data
- `ExerciseData`: Raw JSON structure for exercises
- `MapExerciseData`: Extended with map-specific data (zoom, country, panIndex)

### Data Management

**`data/useLearningData.ts`** - The Core Composable
- **Data Loading**: Imports and processes JSON data into typed objects
- **Relationship Building**: Creates parent-child and exercise-parent relationships
- **Exercise Selection**: `pickDueExercise()` - intelligent exercise selection with blocking logic
- **Statistics**: Functions for calculating exercise and progress statistics
- **Blocking Logic**: `getEffectiveBlockingStatus()` - determines if goals are blocked
- **Progress Integration**: Functions to attach progress data to learning goals

**`data/learningGoals.min.json` & `exercises.min.json`**
- Raw data files containing all learning goals and exercises
- Generated once by Python scripts
- Used as the source of truth for the learning system

### Progress Tracking

**`tracking/exercise/ExerciseProgress.ts`**
- Extends FSRS `Card` interface with exercise-specific data
- Adds `exerciseId` and `streak` properties

**`tracking/exercise/exerciseProgressStore.ts`**
- Pinia store managing exercise progress
- `updateProgressFromEvent()`: Updates FSRS state from learning events
- Implements immediate retry logic for incorrect answers
- Persists exercise progress data

**`tracking/learning-goal-progress/LearningGoalProgress.ts`**
- Interface for learning goal progress tracking
- Tracks repetitions, streak, last seen, correct count, priority, blacklist status

**`tracking/learning-goal-progress/learningGoalProgressStore.ts`**
- Pinia store for learning goal progress
- `setProgress()`: Updates progress for a learning goal
- `getProgress()`: Retrieves progress by learning goal name
- Persists learning goal progress data

**`tracking/learning-event/LearningEvent.ts`**
- Interface for learning interaction events
- Tracks timing, clicks, accuracy, and distance data

**`tracking/learning-event/learningEventStore.ts`**
- Pinia store for learning events
- `addEvent()`: Records learning interactions
- Persists learning event history

### User Interface Components

**`views/LearningContentOverviewAdmin.vue`**
- Main admin dashboard showing system-wide statistics
- Displays learning goal counts, exercise counts, progress statistics
- Shows buttons for random exercise selection and due exercise prioritization
- Renders learning goal widgets in hierarchical structure

**`views/LearningGoalWidget.vue`**
- Individual learning goal display component
- Shows progress data, exercise statistics, and blocking status
- Displays lock icons for blocked goals and strikethrough for lifted blocks
- Handles blacklist toggling and child goal expansion
- Shows exercise status percentages and progress summary

**`tracking/learning-goal-progress/AdminViewLearningGoalProgress.vue`**
- Admin view showing recent learning goal progress updates
- Displays progress entries sorted by last seen timestamp
- Shows repetitions, streaks, correct counts, and blacklist status

**`tracking/exercise/AdminViewExerciseProgress.vue`**
- Admin view for exercise progress monitoring
- Shows FSRS data including due dates, stability, difficulty
- Displays exercise performance metrics and scheduling

**`tracking/learning-event/AdminViewLearnEvents.vue`**
- Admin view for learning event analysis
- Shows detailed interaction data including timing and accuracy
- Displays last 100 learning events for analysis

### Game Integration

**`play/Play.vue`**
- Main game interface for country learning
- Integrates with `WorldMapGame` component for map interactions
- Handles exercise completion and progress updates
- Calls `pickDueExercise()` for intelligent exercise selection
- Updates both exercise and learning goal progress on completion

**`play/ExerciseInstruction.vue`**
- Component for displaying exercise instructions
- Shows the task text for each country exercise

### Icons and Visual Elements

**`icons/IconLockClosed.vue` & `icons/IconLockOpen.vue`**
- Visual indicators for blocked and lifted learning goals
- Used in learning goal widgets to show blocking status

## Key Functions and Their Roles

### Exercise Selection (`useLearningData.ts`)
- `pickDueExercise()`: Main exercise selection with due/new prioritization
- `getAllAncestorsInclSelf()`: Gets all ancestors for blocking checks
- `getEffectiveBlockingStatus()`: Determines if goals are effectively blocked
- `isBlockingGoalLifted()`: Checks if blocking goals have 50%+ exercises not due

### Progress Calculation (`useLearningData.ts`)
- `getExerciseStatisticsForLearningGoal()`: Calculates exercise status for a goal
- `getUniqueOverallExerciseStatistics()`: System-wide exercise stats without double-counting
- `getOverallProgressStatistics()`: System-wide learning goal progress stats
- `getBlacklistStatistics()`: Statistics for blacklisted learning goals

### Data Management (`useLearningData.ts`)
- `getLearningGoalsWithProgress()`: Attaches progress data to learning goals
- `getLearningGoalWithProgress()`: Single learning goal with progress
- `updateLearningGoalProgress()`: Updates progress recursively for goal and ancestors
- `findLearningGoalsByExerciseId()`: Finds which goals contain an exercise

### Store Actions
- `exerciseProgressStore.updateProgressFromEvent()`: Updates FSRS state from events
- `learningGoalProgressStore.setProgress()`: Updates learning goal progress
- `learningEventStore.addEvent()`: Records learning interactions

This creates a comprehensive learning system that guides users through geographical knowledge systematically, ensures retention through spaced repetition, and adapts to individual learning patterns.
