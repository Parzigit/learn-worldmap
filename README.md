## Development

### Testing

For now, there are some E2E tests, which were recorded with Playwright.
You'll find them in the `tests/` directory.

To run them, execute the app with the test env var set, by running:

```
npm run testdev
```

Leave this running, and in another terminal, run the tests:

```
npm run test:e2e
```
